                        <p></p>Many people who work in London prefer to live outside it, and to go in to their offices or schools every day by train, car or bus, even though this means they have to get up early in the morning and reach home late in the evening.

                        <p></p>One advantage of living outside London is that houses are cheaper. Even a small flat in London without a garden costs quite a lot to rent. With the same money, one can get a little house in the country with a garden of one‘s own.

                        <p></p>Then, in the country one can really get away from the noise and hurry of busy working lives. Even though one has to get up earlier and spend more time in trains or buses, one can sleep better at night and during weekends and on summer evenings, one can enjoy the fresh, clean air of the countr y. If one likes garden, one can spend one‘s free time digging, planting, watering and doing the hundred and one other jobs which are needed in a garden. Then, when the flowers and vegetables come up, one has got the reward together with those who have shared the secret of Nature.

                        <p></p>Some people, however, take no interest in country things: for them, happiness lies in the town, with its cinemas and theatres, beautiful shops and busy streets, dance-halls and restaurants. Such people would feel that their life was not worth living if they had to live it outside London. An occasional walk in one of the parks and a fortnight‘s (two weeks) visit to the sea every summer is all the country they want: the rest they are quite prepared to leave to those who are glad to get away from London every night.

                        <p></p>1. Which of the following statements is NOT true?

                        <p></p>Passage 1

                        <p></p>Many people who work in London prefer to live outside it, and to go in to their offices or schools every day by train, car or bus, even though this means they have to get up early in the morning and reach home late in the evening.

                        <p></p>One advantage of living outside London is that houses are cheaper. Even a small flat in London without a garden costs quite a lot to rent. With the same money, one can get a little house in the country with a garden of one‘s own.

                        <p></p>Then, in the country one can really get away from the noise and hurry of busy working lives. Even though one has to get up earlier and spend more time in trains or buses, one can sleep better at night and during weekends and on summer evenings, one can enjoy the fresh, clean air of the countr y. If one likes garden, one can spend one‘s free time digging, planting, watering and doing the hundred and one other jobs which are needed in a garden. Then, when the flowers and vegetables come up, one has got the reward together with those who have shared the secret of Nature.

                        <p></p>Some people, however, take no interest in country things: for them, happiness lies in the town, with its cinemas and theatres, beautiful shops and busy streets, dance-halls and restaurants. Such people would feel that their life was not worth living if they had to live it outside London. An occasional walk in one of the parks and a fortnight‘s (two weeks) visit to the sea every summer is all the country they want: the rest they are quite prepared to leave to those who are glad to get away from London every night.

                            习近平在主持学习时发表了讲话。他首先表示，再过几天，就是我们党成立98周年了，我代表党中央，向全国广大党员致以节日的祝贺！

　　                        <p>习近平指出，安排这次中央政治局集体学习，目的是总结党的历史经验，结合新时代新要求，推动全党围绕守初心、担使命，找差距、抓落实切实搞好主题教育。这也是中央政治局带头开展主题教育的一项重要安排。中央政治局的同志要作好示范，在不忘初心、牢记使命上为全党作表率。</p>

                            <p>习近平强调，我们党是用马克思主义武装起来的政党，始终把为中国人民谋幸福、为中华民族谋复兴作为自己的初心和使命，并一以贯之体现到党的全部奋斗之中。回顾党的历史，为什么我们党在那么弱小的情况下能够逐步发展壮大起来，在腥风血雨中能够一次次绝境重生，在攻坚克难中能够不断从胜利走向胜利，根本原因就在于不管是处于顺境还是逆境，我们党始终坚守为中国人民谋幸福、为中华民族谋复兴这个初心和使命，义无反顾向着这个目标前进，从而赢得了人民衷心拥护和坚定支持。中国特色社会主义进入新时代，我们比历史上任何时期都更接近、更有信心和能力实现中华民族伟大复兴。我们千万不能在一片喝彩声、赞扬声中丧失革命精神和斗志，逐渐陷入安于现状、不思进取、贪图享乐的状态，而是要牢记船到中流浪更急、人到半山路更陡，把不忘初心、牢记使命作为加强党的建设的永恒课题，作为全体党员、干部的终身课题。</p>
